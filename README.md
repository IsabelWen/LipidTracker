# LipidTracker

## Project description
The objective of this project is to develop an app for tracking LDL, HDL, and triglyceride values by inputting values and dates from blood tests. The app will visualize data to show trends over time, enabling users to monitor improvements or changes. Users can also note dietary or medication adjustments to better understand their influence on cholesterol levels.

## User Stories
1. As a user, I want to be able to input my LDL, HDL, and triglyceride values along with the date of the blood test, so that I can keep track of my cholesterol levels over time.
2. As a user, I want the app to visually represent my cholesterol data in easy-to-understand graphs, so that I can quickly identify any patterns or trends in my cholesterol levels.
3. As a user, I want to be able to make notes about any dietary or medication changes alongside my cholesterol data, so that I can see how these changes may be affecting my cholesterol levels.
